  <p>Robin has declared a function that prints the squares of odd numbers in the specified range. Unfortunately, several function calls gave an unexpected result. The function itself seems to be fine. Help Robin&nbsp;figure out what went&nbsp;wrong in these calls and fix them.</p> 
  <p>For each case, the required range is written in a&nbsp;comment.</p>
